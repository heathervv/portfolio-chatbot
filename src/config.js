The mission for this product line was to connect patients to top-tier dentists in their neighbourhood based on their wants/needs. Operating in both Canada and the United States, we built and maintained a marketing site (opencare.com), a patient app, and a practice app. There was *a lot* we managed to build, but I\'m personally most proud of the completely rebuilt patient funnel (search.opencare.com/recommendation) which I built entirely in React to replace the original in AngularJS, and mentoring the team through improving QA processes, app accessibility, and feature scoping.',

This was done through an internal product that enabled the operations team to work through cases. When I joined this product line, the relationship between product and operations was strained - the product team was operating under a "ship fast and often" ethos, which, while great, often disrupted the operations team as they had tight timelines and had a low risk threshold for bugs and mid-day releases. So I focused on improving this communication-breakdown by refreshing the bug process and introducing functional reviews with key stakeholders before releases.',
